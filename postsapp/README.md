# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Simple mock API has been used

Tech used:
React,
Redux,
MaterialUI,
Jest,

# What it does?

It fetches all the random posts from the URL: Jasonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
Since its not actually a CRUD, it will mock the status of 201 when trying to add data to it.
You can check the network tab to ensure API calls are run successfully.


# Thank you
